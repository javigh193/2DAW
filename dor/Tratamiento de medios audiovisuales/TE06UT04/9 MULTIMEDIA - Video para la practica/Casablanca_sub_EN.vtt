01:36:07.619 --> 01:36:10.705
If you don't mind, fill in the names.
That'll make it more official.

01:36:10.872 --> 01:36:12.916
You think of everything, don't you?

01:36:13.124 --> 01:36:15.543
And the names are
Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

01:36:15.710 --> 01:36:19.297
- But why my name, Richard?
- Because you're getting on that plane.

01:36:19.464 --> 01:36:21.049
I don't understand.
What about you?

01:36:21.216 --> 01:36:23.343
I'm staying with him
till the plane gets away.

01:36:23.551 --> 01:36:25.512
No. What has happened?
Last night you said...

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:27.472
Last night we said a great many things.

01:36:27.639 --> 01:36:29.557
You said I was to do the thinking for us.

01:36:29.724 --> 01:36:32.394
I've done a lot of it since then.
It adds up to one thing:

01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:35.230
You're getting on that plane
with Victor where you belong.

01:36:35.397 --> 01:36:37.232
Now, you've got to listen to me.

01:36:37.399 --> 01:36:40.276
Any idea what you'd have
to look forward to if you stayed here?

01:36:40.485 --> 01:36:43.738
Chances are we'd both wind up
in a concentration camp. True, Louis?

01:36:43.905 --> 01:36:46.199
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.

01:36:46.408 --> 01:36:49.786
- You're saying this only to make me go.
- I'm saying it because it's true.

01:36:49.995 --> 01:36:52.247
Inside of us we both know
you belong with Victor.

01:36:52.414 --> 01:36:54.749
You're part of his work,
the thing that keeps him going.

01:36:54.916 --> 01:36:57.794
If that plane leaves
and you're not with him, you'll regret it.

01:36:58.003 --> 01:37:01.506
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

01:37:02.424 --> 01:37:04.467
But what about us?

01:37:04.676 --> 01:37:06.052
We'll always have Paris.

01:37:06.261 --> 01:37:09.222
We didn't have... We'd lost it
until you came to Casablanca.

01:37:09.597 --> 01:37:11.266
We got it back last night.

01:37:12.183 --> 01:37:15.937
- When I said I would never leave you.
- And you never will.

01:37:16.438 --> 01:37:17.939
But I've got a job to do too.

01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:19.649
Where I'm going, you can't follow.

01:37:19.774 --> 01:37:21.901
What I've got to do
you can't be any part of.

01:37:22.527 --> 01:37:24.029
Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble.

01:37:24.195 --> 01:37:27.657
But it doesn't take much to see
that the problems of three little people...

01:37:27.866 --> 01:37:30.535
...don't amount to a hill of beans
in this crazy world.

01:37:30.702 --> 01:37:33.246
Someday you'll understand that.

01:37:34.456 --> 01:37:36.166
Now, now.

01:37:37.792 --> 01:37:40.128
Here's looking at you, kid.

01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:57.771
- Everything is in order.
- All except one thing.

01:37:57.979 --> 01:38:00.148
There's something you should know.

01:38:00.398 --> 01:38:02.150
I don't ask you to explain anything.

01:38:02.317 --> 01:38:05.445
I'm going to anyway.
It may make a difference to you later on.

01:38:05.654 --> 01:38:07.489
You said you knew about Ilsa and me.

01:38:07.656 --> 01:38:10.492
You didn't know she was at my place
last night when you were.

01:38:10.659 --> 01:38:14.120
She came there for the letters of transit.
Isn't that true, Ilsa?

01:38:14.579 --> 01:38:15.789
Yes.

01:38:15.997 --> 01:38:17.999
She tried everything to get them.
Nothing worked.

01:38:18.166 --> 01:38:21.670
She did her best to convince me
that she was still in love with me.

01:38:21.836 --> 01:38:24.381
But that was all over long ago.

01:38:24.589 --> 01:38:27.842
For your sake, she pretended it wasn't,
and I let her pretend.

01:38:28.343 --> 01:38:29.969
I understand.

01:38:30.178 --> 01:38:32.347
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

01:38:33.014 --> 01:38:34.849
I appreciate it.

01:38:35.684 --> 01:38:37.477
Welcome back to the fight.

01:38:37.686 --> 01:38:40.188
This time I know our side will win.

01:38:53.952 --> 01:38:56.079
Are you ready, Ilsa?

01:38:57.956 --> 01:38:59.332
Yes, I'm ready.

01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:03.837
Goodbye, Rick.

01:39:04.713 --> 01:39:06.589
God bless you.

01:39:07.966 --> 01:39:10.635
You better hurry.
You'll miss that plane.

01:39:28.737 --> 01:39:30.613
I was right.
You are a sentimentalist.

01:39:30.822 --> 01:39:33.616
Stay where you are.
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:39:33.825 --> 01:39:35.118
What you just did for Laszlo.

01:39:35.327 --> 01:39:37.704
That fairy tale you invented
to send Ilsa away with him.

01:39:37.912 --> 01:39:40.206
I know a little about women, my friend.
She went.

01:39:40.415 --> 01:39:42.417
But she knew you were lying.

01:39:42.584 --> 01:39:44.544
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.

01:39:44.753 --> 01:39:48.006
I suppose you know this isn't
going to be pleasant for either of us.

01:39:48.173 --> 01:39:49.341
Especially for you.

01:39:49.507 --> 01:39:52.677
- I'll have to arrest you, of course.
- As soon as the plane goes, Louis.

01:39:59.768 --> 01:40:01.645
What was the meaning
of that phone call?

01:40:01.770 --> 01:40:04.064
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.

01:40:06.608 --> 01:40:08.735
Why do you stand here?
Why don't you stop him?

01:40:08.943 --> 01:40:10.945
Ask Monsieur Rick.

01:40:13.281 --> 01:40:16.076
- Get away from that phone.
- I advise you not to interfere.

01:40:16.284 --> 01:40:19.537
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault,
and I'm willing to shoot you.

01:40:21.539 --> 01:40:23.083
- Hello!
- Put that phone down.

01:40:23.291 --> 01:40:25.126
- Get me the radio tower.
- Put it down! 

01:40:40.141 --> 01:40:41.726
Major Strasser has been shot.

01:40:46.481 --> 01:40:49.150
Round up the usual suspects.

01:41:12.841 --> 01:41:15.010
Well, Rick,
you're not only a sentimentalist...

01:41:15.176 --> 01:41:16.803
...but you've become a patriot.

01:41:16.928 --> 01:41:19.139
Maybe, but it seemed
like a good time to start.

01:41:19.264 --> 01:41:21.266
I think perhaps you're right.

01:41:46.041 --> 01:41:49.753
It might be a good idea for you to
disappear from Casablanca for a while.

01:41:49.961 --> 01:41:52.380
There's a Free French garrison
over at Brazzaville.

01:41:52.547 --> 01:41:56.343
- I could be induced to arrange a passage.
- My letter of transit?

01:41:56.551 --> 01:41:57.802
I could use a trip.

01:41:58.053 --> 01:42:01.264
But it doesn't change our bet.
You still owe me 10,000 francs.

01:42:01.556 --> 01:42:04.392
That 10,000 francs
should pay our expenses.

01:42:04.559 --> 01:42:05.810
"Our" expenses?

01:42:06.645 --> 01:42:10.857
Louis, I think this is the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.
